## Notes

1. <a name="fn-1" /> We now revisit the subject of **sa** and **tu**. In this sentence, we see **sa chảq**, which means "a/some day(s)". In general, to interpret **sa \<verb\>**, think "a/some thing(s) which is/are or do/does the thing described by the verb". **sa chảq** "some things which are days", or simply "some days".

2. <a name="fn-2" /> The structure of this sentence differs from all the ones we have seen so far: there is a noun in front of the verb, and there is a strange **bı** before the verb. The two phenomena are closely connected. By using the particle **bı**, it becomes possible to place nouns in front of the verb. This can be done for different reasons. In the present situation, the noun **sa chảq** "some days", followed by **bı**, is placed in front of the verb, and then a sentence of a familiar shape follows: a verb and a noun. The noun is **cháq**, the likes of which you have already met. In previous lessons, it was translated as "the day(s)". When **sa chảq** "some days" was used earlier in the sentence, which is the case here, then any subsequent **cháq** refers to those same days. This is why the English translation of the sentence contains "they are good". It could also have been translated as "Some days, those days are good", or, more formally, "Some days are such that they (those days) are good". We will see many repetitions of this pattern throughout this lesson.

3. <a name="fn-3" /> **bũ** means "not". For now, absorb the word as is.

4. <a name="fn-4" /> Here is the same sentence pattern but with **tu**, "every", instead. Interpreting **tu \<verb\>** works exactly like the **sa** counterpart, except that instead of "some", we have "every". Thus, **tu \<verb\>** means "everything which is or does the thing described by the verb". In the case of **tu chảq**, this gives us "everything which is a day", or, more simply, "every day". As before, the subsequent occurence of **cháq** refers to the same days.

5. <a name="fn-5" /> The pattern **mả ... moq** is used to form yes-no questions. The **moq** indicates that we're dealing with a question, much like **da** indicates that we're dealing with an assertion.

6. <a name="fn-6" /> **há**, "one" or "you", is a generic impersonal pronoun. It is used to refer generically to a person or people, as in "One does not simply walk into Mordor". Like every other pronoun in Toaq, it is gender-neutral.

7. <a name="fn-7" /> **hı rảı** means "what" or "which thing(s)". Here, it appears as the second noun of the verb **fả**, "to go (somewhere)", which is the destination. The literal meaning of "You go what?" should therefore be understood as "What is the destination of your going?", or, more simply, "Where are you going?".
