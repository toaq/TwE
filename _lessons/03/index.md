## Notes

1. <a name="fn-1" /> In the last lesson we learned that there are many verbs in Toaq that would be nouns in English. **kua** "to be a room" is another such word.

2. <a name="fn-2" /> **tı** means "to be at a place", "to be present at" and can be used any time two things exhibit spatial overlap.  **nıe** "to be inside something" would be more specific.

3. <a name="fn-3" /> Now we see **kua** again, but this time with a rising tone ![](../tones/d2.png). While **kua** means "to be a room", **kúa** means "the room(s)" (singular or plural not specified). The transformation from the verb meaning to the noun meaning follows a regular pattern: When applying a rising tone ![](../tones/d2.png) to a verb, the resulting expression refers to things that are or do the thing described by the verb. The meaning of **kua** is "to be a room", so **kúa** must refer to something which "is a room" -- ergo, a room or rooms.

4. <a name="fn-4" /> For now, remember **sá shı** "one", "someone", "something" as is.

5. <a name="fn-5" /> **súq** is not the noun form of any verb, but merely a new personal pronoun, meaning "you".

6. <a name="fn-6" /> **níjuı** "this (thing) here", "these (things) here" and **níjao** "that (thing) there", "those (things) there" are more precise forms of **ní** "this/that", which you are already familiar with. Note that these words can be used with objects and people alike, without being impolite. **Bao** is a verb meaning "to be white": English adjectives, too, correspond to Toaq verbs.

7. <a name="fn-7" /> And one more time, **báo** with a rising tone ![](../tones/d2.png) refers to something which is or does the thing described by the verb "to be white", therefore it refers to something which is white -- it means "the white thing(s)". And analogously: **kía** "the red thing(s)".
